## Description
- **This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.**<br>
## Requirments
 - use starter code contain   and folder :

     - server.js file
     - website folder contains files:
       1. app.js file
       2. style.css
       3. HTML file
       4. In addation to Readme
     <br>
- The project is required to :
    1. Setup a Node environment with Express and the necessary project dependencies.
        - body-parser(middleware)
        - cors
    2. start up an instance of app  

    3. Use the Fetch API with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes .
    4. Access a GET route on the server side, from a function called on the client side
    5. Do chain Promises 5ogethert.
    6. Do access HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamicallys.
      <br>
* **what must I do :**
  1.  Install Node
  2.  Install the packages Express, Body-Parser, and Cors from git bush
  3. Create a server running on the port of my choosing
  4. Add a console.log() to the server callback function, and test that my server is running using Node in the git bush to run the file server.js
  5.  Get API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
  6.  Write an async function in app.js that uses fetch() to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API
  7. Create an event listener for the element with the id: generate, with a callback function to execute when it is clicked.
  8. Need to chain another Promise that makes a POST request to add the API data, as well as data entered by the user, to your app After  successful retrieval of the weather data
  9. Chain another Promise that updates the UI dynamically Write another async function that is called retrieveData after the completed POST request. This function should retrieve data from our app
  10. Select the necessary elements on the DOM (index.html), and then update their necessary values to reflect the dynamic values for:

      - Temperature
      - Date
      - User input
